=== Release keystore generation ===
You'll be prompted for two passwords (use the SAME for both - simpler) and identity fields.
REMEMBER these passwords. Losing them means losing the ability to update your app.

Keystore created at $KEYSTORE_PATH

Next step: create keystore.properties at the project root with:

storeFile=$KEYSTORE_PATH
storePassword=<your-password>
keyAlias=$KEY_ALIAS
keyPassword=<your-password>

Both keystore.properties and keystore/ are gitignored - they MUST stay local.
