/**
 * SC2026 via Bluetooth LE — uses Valve's vendor GATT service (100f6c32-...).
 * The standard HID service 0x1812 is claimed by the OS and requires BLUETOOTH_PRIVILEGED.
 *
 * GATT operations are serialized via a small state machine:
 *   CONNECTED → request MTU → discover services → subscribe N chars one-by-one → send disable lizard → READY
 * Each step waits for its own callback before triggering the next. Duplicate callbacks
 * (Android Bluetooth stack sometimes fires onMtuChanged twice) are ignored.
